Process Mining describes a set of data-driven techniques to discover process models from event logs, to check conformance and monitor processes, and to enhance and improve models. During the last ten years, these techniques have developed into a mature research field with many use cases, resulting in a strong industry uptake. Its main applications can be found in business process management to create actionable insights leveraging existing data from IT systems. However, recent research shows a broader range of Process Mining applications such as in Software Engineering, Human-Computer Interaction, and control of manufacturing processes.
In this presentation, Julian Theis will introduce the fundamentals of Process Mining based on real-world examples. He will also talk about recent research projects in atypical fields and will discuss future directions.

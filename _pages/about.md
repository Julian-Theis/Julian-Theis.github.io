As an application-driven researcher at the intersection of Process Mining and Artificial Intelligence, I am thinking out-of-the-box to develop innovative symbioses which master problems in untypical process mining industries/fields. 

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree in Industrial Engineering and working as a Research and Teaching Assistant in the [Process Mining and Intelligent System Analytics Team](https://prominent.uic.edu) (PROMINENT) at University of Illinois at Chicago. I work on fundamental theoretical Process Mining that can be overcome using Artificial Intelligence methods. At the same time, I am working on the application hybrid Process Mining and Deep Learning applications in the field of Human-Computer Interaction, Programmable Logic Controller design, and Healthcare.

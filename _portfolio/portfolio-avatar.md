AVATAR is the Python implementation of the AdVersarial system vArianT AppRoximation (AVATAR) methodology based on the open source Python process mining platform PM4Py. The original approach is described in the paper [Adversarial System Variant Approximation to Quantify Process Model Generalization](https://julian-theis.github.io/publication/avatar) by Julian Theis and Houshang Darabi.

PyDREAM is the Python implementation of the Decay Replay Mining (DREAM) methodology based on the open source Python process mining platform PM4Py. The original approach is described in the paper [Decay Replay Mining to Predict Next Process Events](https://julian-theis.github.io/publication/dream-nap) by Julian Theis and Houshang Darabi.
